# POLYNOMIAL-REGRESSION
Polynomial Regression is a supervised machine learning technique used to model non-linear relationships between independent variables and a dependent variable. It is an extension of linear regression that introduces polynomial terms (such as squared or cubed features) to better fit complex patterns in data.
